# FEM Projects Collab

This repository houses our collaborative solutions to challenges from Frontend Mentor ([https://www.frontendmentor.io/](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)).  We're using these projects as a platform to sharpen our skills and explore various frontend technologies while emphasizing best practices.

## Project Goals

Our primary objectives for this repository are:

* **Mastering Frontend Technologies:** We're focusing on building a strong foundation in React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and CSS Modules, while also exploring other relevant technologies as needed.
* **Practicing Pragmatism:** We strive to select the most appropriate tools and techniques for each challenge, fostering a deep understanding of their strengths and limitations.  This involves carefully considering factors like project complexity, maintainability, and performance.
* **Embracing Test-Driven Development (TDD):** We're committed to writing tests *before* implementing features, promoting robust and reliable code.
* **Adhering to Angular Commit Style:** We follow the Angular commit message style guide for consistent and informative commit history, facilitating better collaboration and maintainability.
* **Writing Clean Code:**  We emphasize writing readable, maintainable, and well-documented code, employing best practices and striving for consistent style across all projects.


## Technologies Used

The technologies we'll be actively utilizing and improving our proficiency in include:

* **React:** For building user interfaces.
* **TypeScript:**  As our primary language for enhanced type safety and maintainability within our JavaScript projects.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For rapid UI development using a utility-first approach.
* **CSS Modules:**  For scoped CSS to avoid naming conflicts and improve maintainability.
* **[Other Technologies Used]:**  List any additional technologies used in specific projects will be added as well in the readme for each project.

## Project Structure

Each challenge solution will reside in its own dedicated directory within this repository.  The directory name will typically match the challenge title.  Inside each directory, you'll find:

* **`src/`:** Contains the source code for the project.
* **`public/`:** Contains static assets (if any).
* **`test/`:** Contains unit and integration tests (following a TDD approach).
* **`README.md`:** Provides specific details about the individual challenge, including technologies used, design choices, and any notable considerations.
